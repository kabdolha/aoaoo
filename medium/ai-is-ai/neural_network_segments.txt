NEURAL NETWORK COLORED SEGMENTS ANALYSIS
==================================================

NEURON ACTIVATION POINTS
-------------------------
Neuron 4:
  Formula: h4 = ReLU(0.6817 * x_scaled + 0.2601)
  Activates when temperature > 62.9°F
  Effect: INCREASES ice cream consumption

Neuron 2:
  Formula: h2 = ReLU(1.4894 * x_scaled + -0.5163)
  Activates when temperature > 80.7°F
  Effect: INCREASES ice cream consumption

COLORED SEGMENTS ON GRAPH
-------------------------
Segment 1 (Orange): 25.0°F to 62.9°F
  Active neurons: None (baseline only)
  Slope: 0.00 ice creams per °F

Segment 2 (Yellow-Orange): 62.9°F to 80.7°F
  Active neurons: 4
  Slope: 0.23 ice creams per °F

Segment 3 (Yellow): 80.7°F to 115.0°F
  Active neurons: 4, 2
  Slope: 1.23 ice creams per °F

HOW TO READ THE COLORED LINE
------------------------------
Each color represents a different mathematical 'regime':
- When temperature crosses an activation point, a new neuron 'turns on'
- This changes the slope of the line (piecewise linear function)
- More active neurons = steeper slope = faster ice cream growth
- The neural network creates 'smart breakpoints' in the data
